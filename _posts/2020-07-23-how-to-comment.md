We're building a digital community and want to hear your voice.

At the bottom of every blog post is a comment section.
It's built on [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances){:target="_blank"}, which is a lightweight app that saves comments using GitHub issues.
That means:

* you need a (free!) GitHub account to write a comment
* we don't track you or load any scripts that track you
* all comments are visible on the Issues tab of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/{{ site.username }}/{{ site.repo}}){:target="_blank"}

This blog does not currently have its own policy on appropriate comments, but instead adopts the [AGU Code of Conduct](https://www.agu.org/-/media/Files/Learn-About-AGU/AGU_Scientific_Integrity_and_Professional_Ethics_Policy_document.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
We reserve the right to moderate comments, lock conversations, [etc.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/moderating-comments-and-conversations){:target="_blank"} at our discretion.
