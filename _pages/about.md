America's water is at a crossroads.
For years, the world looked to the United States as a leader in scientific and economic water management, and sought to emulate the nation's approach to water development.
Today, however, the United States has no policy or strategic planning process for the management of this crucial resource at the national level.
The America's Water initiative, began at the [Columbia Water Center](https://water.columbia.edu){:target="_blank"}, aims to address the great water infrastructure challenge by re-examining the issues of public-private investment in water systems and outlining the potential for radical technical design and infrastructure management innovations, with the ultimate goal of restoring America's global leadership in infrastructure design and water management in the farms, cities and watercourses of the future.


As part of this vision, we are building an inclusive digital community to share visions of what water security, water sustainability, and water justice might look like in America, the Americas, and beyond.
You can who we are by visiting our [contributors]({{ "/authors" | relative_url }}) page.
If you have a bold idea to share with our readers, we welcome thoughtful contributions from the community -- see [our contribution guide]({{ "/tag/how-to-contribute/" | relative_url }}).
